# Skip Client ID Feature

## Overview
Users can now skip entering their Client ID if they don't have it or can't find it. This makes the verification process more user-friendly and accessible.

## How Users Can Skip

### 1. **Skip Button**
- **⏭️ Skip Client ID** button appears in the keyboard
- One-click skip without typing anything
- Immediately proceeds to verification

### 2. **Text Input**
Users can type any of these to skip:
- `skip`
- `Skip` 
- `SKIP`

## User Interface Updates

### **Instruction Message**
```
🆔 Please enter your Client ID

📍 You can find your Client ID in your Exness Personal Area:

💡 Or type "skip" if you don't have it
```

### **Image Caption**
```
👆 Where to find your Client ID:

1️⃣ Login to your Exness Personal Area
2️⃣ Go to "My Account" section  
3️⃣ Your Client ID is displayed at the top

💡 It's usually a 8-character code like "ab12cd34"

⏭️ Can't find it? Use the Skip button below
```

### **Fallback Text Instructions**
```
📋 How to find your Client ID:

## Button Layout
```
[⏭️ Skip Client ID]
[🔙 Back to Email]
[🏠 Back to Brokers]
```

## Backend Handling

### **Skip Detection**
```javascript
const clientIdInput = ctx.message.text.trim().toLowerCase();

if (clientIdInput === 'skip' || clientIdInput === 'Skip') {
  user.clientId = 'Skipped';
} else {
  user.clientId = ctx.message.text.trim();
}
```

### **Success Message Handling**
When Client ID is skipped, it's not shown in the verification success message:
```javascript
if (user.clientId && user.clientId !== 'Skipped') {
  successMsg += `🆔 Your Client ID: ${user.clientId}\n`;
}
```

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Accessibility**: Users who can't find their Client ID aren't blocked
2. **Flexibility**: Multiple ways to skip (button or text)
3. **Clear Instructions**: Users know they can skip if needed
4. **No Confusion**: Skipped Client ID doesn't appear in success message
5. **Same Verification**: Email-based verification still works perfectly

## Technical Implementation

- **Both Methods**: Button handler and text input detection
- **Case Insensitive**: Accepts "skip", "Skip", "SKIP"
- **Clean Success**: Skipped Client ID doesn't clutter success message
- **Same API Call**: Verification still uses email for Exness API
- **Consistent Flow**: All other steps remain the same

This feature makes the bot more user-friendly while maintaining the core verification functionality!
